        Tigers have reddish-orange coats with prominent black stripes, white bellies and white spots on their ears.
        Like a human fingerprint, no two tigers have the exact same markings. Because of this, researchers can use stripe
        patterns to identify different individuals when studying tigers in the wild. Tigers are powerful hunters with sharp 
        teeth, strong jaws and agile bodies. They are the largest terrestrial mammal whose diet consists entirely of meat; the 
        largest tiger ever recorded was an Amur tiger. The tiger's closest relative is the lion. In fact, without fur, it is 
        difficult to distinguish a tiger from a lion.Tigers are among the largest cats in the world, and the Amur tiger is the 
        largest subspecies with males weighing up to 660 pounds (300 kilograms) and measuring 10 feet (3 meters). Sumatran tigers
         are the smallest subspecies, maxing out at 310 pounds (140 kilograms) and 8 feet (2.4 meters)
